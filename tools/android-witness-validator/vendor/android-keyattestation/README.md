# Android Key Attestation Verifier

A Kotlin library for verifying Android key attestation certificate chains.

## Usage

```kotlin
// Create a verifier with default, Google-rooted trust anchors, revocation
// info, and time source.
val verifier = Verifier(
  GoogleTrustAnchors,                  // Trust anchors source
  ::getGoogleRevocationStatusFromWeb,  // Revoked serials source
  { Instant.now() }                    // Time source
)

// Verify an attestation certificate chain
val result = verifier.verify(certificateChain)

// Handle the verification result
when (result) {
  is VerificationResult.Success -> {
    // Access verified information
    val publicKey = result.publicKey
    val securityLevel = result.securityLevel
    val verifiedBootState = result.verifiedBootState
    val deviceInformation = result.deviceInformation
  }
  is VerificationResult.ChallengeMismatch -> // Handle challenge mismatch
  is VerificationResult.PathValidationFailure -> // Handle validation failure
  is VerificationResult.ChainParsingFailure -> // Handle parsing failure
  is VerificationResult.ExtensionParsingFailure -> // Handle extension parsing issues
  is VerificationResult.ExtensionConstraintViolation -> // Handle constraint violations
}
```

If there is additional verification you'd like to perform on the challenge
associated with the attestation certificate chain, pass in a `ChallengeChecker`
when verifying. For example, if you expect the challenge to be equal to
"challenge123", then usage would look like

```kotlin
// Create a ChallengeChecker
val challengeChecker = ChallengeMatcher(ByteString.copyFromUtf8("challenge123"))

// Verify an attestation certificate chain with the checker
val result = verifier.verify(certificateChain, challengeChecker)
```

If there are multiple checks to perform on the challenge, use a
`ChainedChallengeChecker` to encompass all the individual `ChallengeCheckers`.
Checks in the `ChainedChallengeChecker` halt after the first failure, so take
advantage of this behavior by putting "less expensive" checks first.
For example, if your use case requires the challenge to be equal to an expected
challenge _and_ not seen already (stale), then combine the `ChallengeMatcher`
with an `InMemoryLruCache` like in this sample:

```kotlin
val cacheSize = 100

// Create a ChainedChallengeChecker with desired ChallengeCheckers. The
// coroutineScope is used to run each individual checker.
val challengeChecker =
  ChainedChallengeChecker.of(
    coroutineScope,
    ChallengeMatcher(ByteString.copyFromUtf8("expectedChallenge")),
    InMemoryLruCache(cacheSize),
  )

// Verify an attestation certificate chain with the checker
val result = verifier.verify(certificateChain, challengeChecker)
```

Here, the `ChallengeMatcher` is used first, so we can avoid the cost of checking
against the `InMemoryLruCache` if the challenge doesn't match.

If the implementations in `challengecheckers/` don't fit your needs, simply
extend the `ChallengeChecker` interface.

## Building

```bash
./gradlew build
```

## Testing

```bash
./gradlew test
```

## Roots

The root certificates may be retrieved from https://android.googleapis.com/attestation/root.
The `roots.json` source file in this repo is a mirror of the hosted roots file.
The generated `GoogleTrustAnchors` class is created from `roots.json` during
build time (as a Gradle task).

Android Key Attestation root certificates are documented
[here](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/security-key-attestation#root_certificate).

## Getting Revoked Serials

It's important to check the revoked serials list to prevent allowing accepting
fraudulent attestations from known leaked keys. The revoked serials may be
retrieved from https://android.googleapis.com/attestation/status. This list is
updated relatively frequently so it's important to use a fresh copy of the
revocation list.

The above example will make a network call and parse the revoked serials list
every time `verify` is called. For regularly updated binaries, it may make sense
to build the revoked serial list into the binary.

See [here](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/security-key-attestation#certificate_status)
for more information about the format of the data.
